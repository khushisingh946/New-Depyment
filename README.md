## 🛠️ CRITICAL: FIXING THE 404 ERROR

If your site shows "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here":

1. **The Refresh Trick**:
   - Go to your repo **Settings > Pages**.
   - Clear the **Custom domain** box and click **Save**.
   - Wait 10 seconds.
   - Re-type your domain and click **Save**. This forces GitHub to rebuild the link.
   
2. **Check Visibility**:
   - Scroll to the bottom of **Settings > General**.
   - Ensure the repository is **Public**. (GitHub Pages with custom domains usually requires a Public repo for free accounts).

3. **Check the Actions Tab**:
   - Click **Actions** at the top of the screen.
   - If you see a **Red X**, click it to see why the build failed.
   - If it's a **Green Check**, your site is officially online at your domain.

4. **HTTPS Check**:
   - In **Settings > Pages**, make sure **Enforce HTTPS** is checked. It might take 10-15 minutes to become available after you set the domain.

Once you have pushed these changes, wait 2 minutes for the "Action" to finish before checking your link!
